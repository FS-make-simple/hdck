------------------

 * rading and writing uncertian block ranges to file
 * writing detailed statistics to file
 * `background' mode -- lower priority and less confidence for the results
 * works with single whole disk read, rereads only sectors that are much
   slower than the neighbours
 * uses disk RPM for detecting blocks that are consistently reread by the disk
 * on rereads reads disk cache worth of sectors before the scoring blocks to
   improve quality of the results
