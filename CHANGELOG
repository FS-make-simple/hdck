v 0.4.0 - 2010-10-07
--------------------

  * change to quantile based detection
  * fix a bug in with min-reads == max-reads
  * tweaks to quick mode -- confirm only the 64 worst
  * fix bug with long options --log, --read-sectors and --bad-sectors not 
    working
  * reduced CPU utilisation

v 0.3.0 - 2010-08-25
--------------------

  * reduce number of global variables
  * quick mode
  * more verbose on-line status reporting
  * printing 10 worst (slowest) blocks in result
    std dev, min, max, avg, truncated avg, no of samples

v 0.2.6 - 2010-08-22
--------------------

  * fix printing of Individual block statistics

v 0.2.5 - 2010-08-22
--------------------

  * compare block times to fractions and multiples of rotational delay, 
    not fixed values
  * print simple diagnosis (disk condition)
  * printing status message on multiple lines and on stdout, not stderr
  * log output

v 0.2.4 - 2010-08-11
--------------------

 * make output more human readable
 * fix the problem with maximum number of block reads being 
   min-reads + max-reads

v 0.2.3 - 2010-08-11
--------------------

 * reduce number of unnecessery re-reads
 * add licences to files

v 0.2.2 - 2010-04-10
--------------------

 * bugfix -- fix overreading re-read blocks
 * make the program 64 bit compatible (not tested!)

v 0.2.1 - 2010-04-09
--------------------

 * bugfix -- not rereading blocks that need rereading
 * code clean up -- removed dead code

v 0.2 - 2010-04-08
------------------

 * reading and writing uncertian block ranges to file
 * writing detailed statistics to file
 * `background' mode -- lower priority and less confidence for the results
 * works with single whole disk read, rereads only sectors that are much
   slower than the neighbours
 * uses disk RPM for detecting blocks that are consistently reread by the disk
 * on rereads reads disk cache worth of sectors before the scoring blocks to
   improve quality of the results
